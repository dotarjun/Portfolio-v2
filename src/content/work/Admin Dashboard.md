### Overview

The Ecommerce Admin Dashboard is built using **Next.js**, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It is typed with **TypeScript** for static type checking.

For styling, **Tailwind CSS** is used - a utility-first CSS framework that makes building custom designs fast and easy.

The dashboard leverages **Prisma** as the application ORM for the **MySQL** database hosted on **PlanetScale**. This provides a scalable, fully managed database solution.

The intuitive admin UI is powered by **Shadcn UI**, a React component library designed for building dashboards. It provides responsive, customizable layouts and components out of the box.

**Stripe** handles all payments, subscriptions, and billing. It powers a seamless checkout experience.

Together, these modern web technologies enable building a customizable, full-featured admin dashboard for ecommerce businesses of any size.

The project takes advantage of the strengths of each technology for a fast, scalable, and enjoyable developer experience.
