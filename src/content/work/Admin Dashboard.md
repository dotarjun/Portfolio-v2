### Overview

The Ecommerce Admin Dashboard is built using **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It is typed with **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** for static type checking.

For styling, **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is used - a utility-first CSS framework that makes building custom designs fast and easy.

The dashboard leverages **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)** as the application ORM for the **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** database hosted on **[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)**. This provides a scalable, fully managed database solution.

The intuitive admin UI is powered by **[Shadcn UI](https://shadcn.com/ui)**, a React component library designed for building dashboards. It provides responsive, customizable layouts and components out of the box.

**[Stripe](https://stripe.com/)** handles all payments, subscriptions and billing. It powers a seamless checkout experience.

Together, these modern web technologies enable building a customizable, full-featured admin dashboard for ecommerce businesses of any size. 

The project takes advantage of the strengths of each technology for a fast, scalable, and enjoyable developer experience.
