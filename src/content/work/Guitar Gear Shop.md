### Overview

GuitarGear.Shop is built using **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. It is typed with TypeScript and styled using the **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** utility-first framework.

For state management, **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)** is leveraged for a simple, fast React state solution.

The UI components use **[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)**, a completely unstyled component library that integrates beautifully with Tailwind CSS.

**[Stripe](https://stripe.com/)** powers payments, subscriptions and billing for a smooth checkout experience.

Together, these technologies provide a fast, intuitive, and scalable platform for the GuitarGear.Shop ecommerce experience.
