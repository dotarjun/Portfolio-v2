### Overview

[GuitarGear.shop](https://www.guitargear.shop) is built using **Next.js**, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. It is typed with **TypeScript** and styled using the **Tailwind CSS** utility-first framework.

For state management, **Zustand** is leveraged for a simple, fast React state solution.

The UI components use **Headless UI**, a completely unstyled component library that integrates beautifully with Tailwind CSS.

**Stripe** powers payments, subscriptions and billing for a smooth checkout experience.

Together, these technologies provide a fast, intuitive, and scalable platform for the GuitarGear.Shop ecommerce experience.
