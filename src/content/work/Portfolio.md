### Description

The Portfolio project serves as a digital representation of my professional portfolio. It includes a collection of my projects, contact links and other relevant information to provide an overview of my skills and experience.

The website is built using **[Astro.js](https://astro.build)**, a static site generator that allows for the use of React components and JSX syntax. The website is styled using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, a utility-first CSS framework. The website is hosted on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** and the source code is available on **[GitHub](https://github.com/dotarjun/portfolio-v2)**. The website was designed using **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**, a cloud-based design and prototyping tool.
